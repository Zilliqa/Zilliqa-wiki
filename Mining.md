# Mining Guide

Welcome to Zilliqa testnet-v3, code-named _Mao Shan Wang_. We are inviting all miners to test out the process of joining as a public node on _Mao Shan Wang_ testnet. We hope this exercise will familiarise everyone with the workflow and also help to find out potential bugs before the mainnet launch by end January 2019. We also encourage all community developers to join the _Mao Shan Wang_ testnet in order to better understand the architecture of the Zilliqa network.

## Hardware requirement for _Mao Shan Wang_ testnet
Currently, mining works best with Ubuntu. Other Debian distributions should work too. Please follow the steps [**HERE**](https://itsfoss.com/install-ubuntu-1404-dual-boot-mode-windows-8-81-uefi/) if you wish to dual boot Windows and Ubuntu 16.04.

We currently support both AMD (with OpenCL) and Nvidia (with CUDA) GPUs.

The recommended requirements for Zilliqa mining nodes are:
* x64 Linux operating system such as Ubuntu 16.04.5
* Intel i5 processor or later
* 8GB DRR3 RAM or higher
* NAT environment or Public IP address
* **(Optional)** Any GPU cards [e.g 1 x GTX 1060, 3GB dedicated RAM]

### Network setup
If you are in NAT environment, you can either:
* Do single port forwarding using **Option 1a**. (**DEFAULT OPTION**)
* Enable UPnP mode using **Option 1b** if your router support UPnP.

If you have a public IP address, you can skip this network setup.

> **NOTE:** If you are using a home router, you are most probably in a NAT environment.

* **(Option 1a)** Single port forwarding your local machine IP in the router menu. You can port forward to `30303` for external port (port range), `30303` for internal port (local port) for `BOTH` TCP/UDP protocol in your router menu. An example can be found [**HERE**](https://www.linksys.com/us/support-article?articleNum=136711). 

* **(Option 1b)** Enable UPnP mode on your home router. Please Google your home router setting, an example can be found [**HERE**](https://routerguide.net/how-to-enable-upnp-for-rt-ac66u/). You can check if you have enabled it UPnP by installing the tool below:
   ```
   sudo apt-get install miniupnpc
   ```
   Then type this in the command line:
   ```
   upnpc -s
   ```
   You will get a message "List of UPNP devices found on the network :" **OR** "No IGD UPnP Device found on the network !". 
   The former means UPnP mode has been enabled successfully, while the latter means UPnP mode enabling failed.

### OpenCL driver setup

If you wish to use OpenCL supported GPU for PoW, please run the following to install the OpenCL developer package. You may need to reboot your PC for the installation to take effect.
```
sudo apt install ocl-icd-opencl-dev
```

### CUDA driver setup

If you wish to use CUDA supported GPU for PoW, please download and install CUDA package from [NVIDIA official webpage](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads). You may need to reboot your PC for the installation to take effect. 

### Multiple GPUs setup

If you have multiple OpenCL or CUDA GPUs, they can work concurrently. Please edit the `GPU_TO_USE` parameter in the _**constants.xml**_ file located in your "join" folder to select amount of the GPUs that you would wish to use. 

The index start from `0` and you can select one or more multiple GPUs. For example, `0` for 1 GPU, `0, 1, 2` or `0, 2, 4` for 3 GPUs. Do make sure the largest index corresponds to the number of GPUs you have physically in your mining rig.

## General Information

### Testnet Difficulty
The bootstrapped minimum difficulty level is set at `3` for the _Mao Shan Wang_ testnet. This difficulty level is dynamic and adjusts according to number of nodes that are competing to join the Zilliqa network.

>**NOTE:** Difficulty level is the log2(Difficulty).

### Testnet Epoch Architecture
![Zilliqa Epoch Architecture](https://i.ibb.co/hgY1j3r/Screenshot-2018-11-28-16-29-39.png)

At the start of each DS Epoch, all candidates will run the Proof-of-Work (Ethash algorithm) process for a `300` seconds window in order to compete to join the Zilliqa network.

Then, nodes that fulfilled the `DS_POW_DIFFICULTY` parameter will be able to join as DS nodes. While, nodes that fulfilled the `POW_DIFFICULTY` parameter will join as shard nodes.

There are a total of `100` TX epochs (each ~1 min) within each DS Epoch (~1.5 hrs). The 100th TX epoch is known as the **Vacuous epoch**.
> The illustration above depicts the Zilliqa mainnet epoch architecture. For _Mao Shan Wang_ testnet, we are including 100 TX blocks in each DS epoch instead for testing purposes.

A vacuous epoch handles the coinbase transactions (reward mechanism), upgrade mechanism (as there are no forks in pBFT), and persistent state storage (writing to nodes’ DB instead of just storing in just the memory). During a vacuous epoch, the network does not process any regular transactions.

### Reward Mechanism
In the Zilliqa network, rewards are based on the amount of signatures done by a node during a DS epoch. Signatures that are submitted by both shard and DS nodes are rewarded equally. The rewards are consolidated for a DS epoch and given out during the vacuous epoch.

Say for example, if there are a total of `1,200` nodes in the Zilliqa network and the `COINBASE_REWARD` is set at `10,000,000` ZILs per DS Epoch, the reward distributed per signature will be:

`10,000,000 / (1,200 * 2/3 [Successful signers] * 99 [TX blocks]) = 126.262626262626263 ZILs per signature`

## Steps for mining with docker (For CPU or Nvidia GPUs only)
1. Install Ubuntu 16.04.5 OS by following instructions here: http://releases.ubuntu.com/xenial/.
***

2. Install Docker CE for Ubuntu by following instructions here: https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/.
***

3. **(Optional)** Install Nvidia CUDA drivers as mentioned above [**HERE**](#cuda-driver-setup). You can skip this step if you are mining with CPU.
***

4. Make a new directory in your Desktop and change directory to it:
    ```
    cd ~/Desktop && mkdir join && cd join
    ```
***

5. Get the docker image in your command prompt:
    ```
    wget https://testnet-join.zilliqa.com/configuration.tar.gz
    tar zxvf configuration.tar.gz
    ```
***

6. Ensure that your docker image is the latest:
    ```
    sudo docker pull zilliqa/zilliqa:testnetv3
    ```
***

7. Find out your current IP address in the command prompt and record it down.

   > **NOTE:** If you are using **Option 1b** as stated in the [Network Setup](#network-setup) above, you can skip this step.
    
      ```
      curl https://ipinfo.io/ip
      ```
***

8. Run the shell script in your command prompt to launch your docker image.
    * **(Option 1)** For CPU mining:
       ```
       ./launch_docker.sh
       ```
    * **(Option 2)** For Nvidia GPUs mining, please first install the nvidia-docker [**HERE**](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker#ubuntu-140416041804-debian-jessiestretch). Then, launch the mining docker in the command prompt with:
       ```
       ./launch_docker.sh --cuda
       ```

       > **NOTE:** If you wish to run multiple Nvidia GPUs concurrently, you will need to modify your _**constants.xml**_ file following instructions as found above [HERE](#multiple-gpus-setup).

       > **NOTE:** Unfortunately, there is no direct support for this docker build for AMD GPUs. We recommend you to build Zilliqa natively instead of using docker by following instructions below [HERE](#steps-for-mining-natively).
***

9. You will then be prompted to enter some information as shown below:
    * `Assign a name to your container (default: zilliqa):` _[Press **Enter** to skip if using default]_

    * `Enter your IP address ('NAT' or *.*.*.*):` _[Key in your public IP address as found in step 7 **OR** NAT]_

    * `Enter your listening port (default: 30303):` _[Press **Enter** to skip if using default]_

***

10. You are now a miner in _Mao Shan Wang_ testnet. You can monitor your progress using:
    ```
    tail -f zilliqa-00001-log.txt
    ``` 
    You will be notified in the logs when you become a shard/DS node in the network, if you managed to win the PoW process at the start of the DS epoch.
***

11. To check your locally generated public and private key pairs, you can enter this in your command prompt:
    ```
    less mykey.txt
    ```
    The first hex string is your **public key**, and the second hex string is your **private key**.

    >**NOTE:** The key pair is generated locally on your disk. Do remember to keep your private key somewhere safe!
***

12. To stop mining with docker:
    ```
    sudo docker stop [DOCKER NAME]
    ```
